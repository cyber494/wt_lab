2. **Troubleshooting and Debugging**: Helping to diagnose and resolve issues related to system performance, application errors, and other operational problems by providing detailed insights into system activity.

3. **Security Analysis**: Identifying suspicious or malicious activity by monitoring unexpected changes or unusual patterns in system processes, files, and Registry keys.

4. **Compliance and Auditing**: Providing a detailed log of system activity that can be used for auditing purposes, ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations.

5. **Understanding Application Behavior**: Offering developers and IT professionals an in-depth view of how applications interact with the system, which can be useful for optimizing performance, debugging, and development.

6. **Detecting Configuration Issues**: Highlighting misconfigurations or incorrect system settings by showing the exact changes being made to the system.
